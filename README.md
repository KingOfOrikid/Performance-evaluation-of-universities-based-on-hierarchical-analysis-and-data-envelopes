# Performance-evaluation-of-universities-based-on-hierarchical-analysis-and-data-envelopes
Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a comprehensive analysis of material and spiritual indicators of some universities in Ontario, Canada is conducted, and corresponding performance evaluations of the universities are made.

## Introduction
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a method for solving complex multi-criteria decision-making problems, which can rank alternatives according to different criteria to achieve the objective. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a method for evaluating the relative efficiency of comparable units based on input and output indicators using linear programming. This project uses the AHP and DEA to conduct a comprehensive analysis of material and spiritual indicators of some universities in Ontario, Canada, and then make corresponding comprehensive evaluations of their performance.
